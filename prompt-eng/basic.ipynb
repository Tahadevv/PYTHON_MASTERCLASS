      "Determining the \"best\" French cheese can be quite subjective, as it depends on personal taste. France is renowned for its wide variety of cheeses, with estimates suggesting there are over 1,600 different types. Here are a few highly regarded French cheeses across various categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Soft Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Brie de Meaux**: Often referred to as the \"King of Cheeses,\" it has a rich, creamy interior and a bloomy rind.\n",
      "   - **Camembert de Normandie**: Another famous soft cheese with a creamy center and a white, edible rind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Semi-Soft Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Reblochon**: Known for its nutty taste and smooth, supple interior.\n",
      "   - **Morbier**: Recognizable by its layer of ash in the middle, with a mild, slightly nutty flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hard Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Comté**: A firm, pressed cheese with a complex flavor profile that includes notes of fruit, nuts, and spices.\n",
      "   - **Beaufort**: Similar to Comté, it has a firm texture and a rich, nutty flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blue Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Roquefort**: A famous blue cheese made from sheep's milk, with a tangy, salty flavor and distinctive veins of blue mold.\n",
      "   - **Bleu d'Auvergne**: A strong, creamy blue cheese with a pungent aroma.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Goat Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Sainte-Maure de Touraine**: A log-shaped goat cheese with a tangy flavor and a distinctive ash-covered rind.\n",
      "   - **Crottin de Chavignol**: A small, round goat cheese with a dense, slightly crumbly interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the \"best\" French cheese is a matter of personal preference, and trying a variety of types is the best way to discover your favorite.\n"
